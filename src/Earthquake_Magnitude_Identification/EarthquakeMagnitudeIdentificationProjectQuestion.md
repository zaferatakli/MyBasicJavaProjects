# 🌍 Earthquake Magnitude Classification Project

## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to develop a simple program that determines an appropriate descriptor based on the earthquake magnitude entered by the user.

---

## 🛠️ Tasks

- The program will take **earthquake magnitude** input from the user.
- The entered magnitude value will be checked against ranges on the **Richter scale**.
- A corresponding **descriptor** will be displayed on the screen.
- ➕ Example: If the user enters `5.5`, the program will indicate that an earthquake with a magnitude of **5.5 is considered a moderate earthquake**.

## 📋 Algorithm / Pseudocode

*Pseudocode is used to outline the main algorithm of a program in a language-neutral and easy-to-understand format:*

1. Take **earthquake magnitude** input (`magnitude`) from the user.
2. If `magnitude` is less than **2.0**:  
   → Print `"Micro"`
3. If `magnitude` is between **2.0** and **3.0**:  
   → Print `"Very minor"`
4. If `magnitude` is between **3.0** and **4.0**:  
   → Print `"Minor"`
5. If `magnitude` is between **4.0** and **5.0**:  
   → Print `"Light"`
6. If `magnitude` is between **5.0** and **6.0**:  
   → Print `"Moderate"`
7. If `magnitude` is between **6.0** and **7.0**:  
   → Print `"Strong"`
8. If `magnitude` is between **7.0** and **8.0**:  
   → Print `"Major"`
9. If `magnitude` is between **8.0** and **10.0**:  
   → Print `"Great"`
10. If `magnitude` is greater than **10.0**:  
    → Print `"Meteoric"`
11. End the program.

## 📌 Key Considerations

- ✅ The program should **accurately evaluate** the user input.
- ✅ The correct **descriptor** must be selected based on the Richter scale.
- ✅ Follow the **algorithm above** to implement the core logic.
- ✅ The application should be a **simple console-based program**.
